# txt_summarizer

txt_summarizer is a text summarization tool implemented in Python, leveraging deep learning techniques to generate concise and coherent summaries from lengthy text documents.

## Features

- **Attention Mechanisms:** Utilizes advanced attention mechanisms to enhance summarization quality.
- **Jupyter Notebook Implementation:** Designed for ease of experimentation and visualization.
- **Python-Based:** Ensures accessibility and flexibility for customization and integration with other projects.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook txt_summarizer.ipynb
    ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load your text data and generate summaries.

### Loading Data

The notebook provides detailed steps to load your text data, whether it's from local files or a dataset. Ensure your data is in a readable format (e.g., plain text or CSV).

### Training the Model

The notebook walks you through training the summarization model, including data preprocessing, model architecture setup, and training execution. The training process leverages the attention mechanisms to improve the quality of the generated summaries.

### Generating Summaries

After training, use the provided functions in the notebook to generate summaries from new text inputs. The notebook includes examples and explanations to help you understand how to use the model effectively.

## Files

- `attention.py`: Contains the implementation of the attention mechanism used for text summarization.
- `txt_summarizer.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the main code for loading data, training the model, and generating summaries.
